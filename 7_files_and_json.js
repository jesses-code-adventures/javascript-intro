/*
 * So far we've covered different ways to process data, but where does the data come from?
 * In the real world, you're often fetching it from a database or an external API.
 * An external API is basically like a website without the part you see.
 * Under the hood, when you go to www.google.com, you make a GET request to google.
 * The server then sends you back a response with the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - a webpage.
 * Working with code, we don't need all that - most commonly we just work with JSON.
 * JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
 * Since you've already worked with JavaScript objects and arrays, you basically know JSON.
 *
 * Throughout this tutorial we will commonly write JSON to a file and read it back.
 * I do this a lot when testing so you don't need to constantly fetch data from an API.
 * This speeds up your development process a lot.

    Here we will create simple javascript object and write it to a json file.
