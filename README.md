# An Introduction To Javascript

Hello! This repository is designed for me to teach friends & coworkers the basics of coding.

To get yourself started, please do the following:

- [Install VSCode (We will learn vim at some point, but we're not ready)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- In VSCode, open your terminal using alt+` (the tick is located above the tab button on your keyboard) for Windows, or control+` on Mac.
