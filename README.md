# An Introduction To Javascript

Hello! This repository is designed for me to teach friends & coworkers the basics of coding.

To get yourself started, please do the following:

## Prerequisites

- [Install VSCode (We will learn vim at some point, but we're not ready)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- In VSCode, open your terminal using alt+\` (the tick is located above the tab button on your keyboard) for Windows, or control+\` on Mac.
- Type `node -v` into your terminal and press enter. This will tell you the version of node that's currently installed.
- If node isn't installed, [install node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and retry using `node -v` to verify the installation has worked.
- Type `git -v` into your terminal and press enter. This will tell you the version of Git that's currently installed.
- If git isn't installed, [install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and retry using `git -v` to verify the installation has worked.
- Don't worry about installing a GUI for git.
- In the Extensions tab of VSCode, search "Prettier" and install it.

## Clone and Open This Repository

- Create a directory on your computer where your code will live.
- Navigate to your Coding directory in your vscode terminal
- Run `git clone https://github.com/jesses-code-adventures/javascript-intro` in the terminal
