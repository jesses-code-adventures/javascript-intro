/*
 * Welcome to your javascript introduction!
 * This is going to be a simple intro on how to run javascript code that you run in the terminal.
 * Javascript is usually run in a web browser which is why it's so widely used, but this is a nice way of understanding how things work.
 * You can run javascript in the terminal by typing `node` and then the name of the file you want to run.
 * For example, if you want to run this file, you would type `node 1_running_your_code.js` in the terminal.
 * Note: You must be in the same directory as the file you want to run. If you're not, you would have to type the path to the file.
 * Below is a tiny amount of code that prints "Hello World" to the terminal - try to run it yourself!

console.log("Hello World!");
