/*
 * Functions are fundamental to basically every programming language. They allow us to write code once and then use it over and over again.
 * With our earlier examples, we've been raw-dogging our code in the file we're in. It runs top to bottom, and that's it.
 * Here we will explore creating functions that we can redeploy throughout our code.
 * We will also touch on scope a little more, as functions are a great way to control scope.
